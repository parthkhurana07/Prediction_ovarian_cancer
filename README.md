# Predictive Analysis of Ovarian Cancer

## Introduction
This project, authored by Parth Khurana, focuses on the Predictive Analysis of Ovarian Cancer. It utilizes a dataset from Kaggle to classify types of ovarian cancer using various biomarkers. The project aims to distinguish between Benign Tumor and Ovarian Cancer, crucial for early and accurate diagnosis.

## Dataset
The dataset comprises 349 cases, each described by 51 variables. These include various biomarkers relevant to ovarian cancer.

## Objective
The primary goal is to develop a predictive model that can accurately classify cases into Benign Tumor or Ovarian Cancer categories. This classification is vital for formulating effective treatment strategies.

## Methods
1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing data for analysis.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding patterns and trends in the dataset.
3. Feature Selection: Identifying the most relevant variables for the classification task.
4. Model Development: Building and training classification models.
5. Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the models.

## Technologies Used
R Language: For data processing and analysis.

Relevant R Libraries: For statistical modeling and visualization.
